```
This project is a wwebjs fork with more features imported from WPP, developed using playwright and wajs.
This is an unofficial whatsapp library.
You can get banned for using this library.
Im not responsible if you got banned.
If you need example you can find in on the examples folder 

Why am I using playwright?
In my opinion playwright is faster than puppeteer
